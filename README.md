# pde-stuff

meshstuff has a mesh class and some methods
algos has various simulation algos for use with meshstuff

The other files (heat1d.py, heat2d.py, burgers.py) can each be executed to run a mesh simulation

Note: There's a bug with the visualization for heat2d, but it's just a problem with the plot, not the mesh values
